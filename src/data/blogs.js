        content: [{ type: "text", value: `Ever since my childhood, I have always been fascinated by technology. I was very curious about tech stuff. Whenever I got somebody's phone, I used to test and explore it to the fullest. \"What does this button do?\" \"What happens if I click here?\" \"What‚Äôs this feature?\"‚Äîthese were the questions that always came to my mind. By the time I was six, I already knew what features phones had and the differences between different models. If there was any problem with anyone's phone in my neighborhood, they would first ask me to look at it, and most of the time, it was just a simple issue that I could solve.` },

        { type: "text", value: `I come from a middle-class family, so I wasn't exposed to computers and the internet. In fact, no one in my house had a touchscreen smartphone. All we had were button phones. The first time I saw a computer was in a cyber caf√©. We used to go there and play games for hours. That was my first introduction to computers. Soon, I learned about the internet too, but I didn‚Äôt have my own computer‚Äînot for another decade. After some years, my dad bought the first smartphone in our house. With that, I could fully explore what the internet had to offer. I learned about websites. I still remember the first website I visited: "www.waptrick.com". A friend had told me about it‚Äîit allowed us to download games for the Android phone we had back then.` },

        { type: "text", value: `The first time I saw and used a laptop was at my neighbor‚Äôs house. I was suddenly exposed to so much new tech, and I was eager to explore it all. However, my school didn‚Äôt help much at the start. In school, they taught only the basics, like creating folders, deleting files, and a few command-line prompts like mkdir, ls, cd, etc. I found it boring. But when I reached grade 9, our syllabus included HTML. That was the push I needed to dive into web development.` },

        { type: "text", value: `We started by learning the basics of HTML‚Äîtags, types of tags, and basic tags like <html>, <title>, <head>, <body>, <br>, <img>, etc. I still remember we used to code on Notepad, and we had to remember all the syntax and write everything from scratch. I made a simple web page and wrote down the address of the page from my school computer in my notebook. I typed that same link into my dad's phone, hoping it would open so I could show my parents what I had done. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt work. I was shocked because other websites opened when I did the same. The next day, I asked my teacher why, and he replied, \"What we are making in the school lab is just a web page. For us to access it from anywhere, we have to deploy it over the internet.\" At that time, what he said went straight over my head. I didn‚Äôt have proper internet access to look it up either. All I knew was how to create a basic HTML page that ran locally on a computer.` },

        { type: "text", value: `After high school, I moved to Kathmandu for higher studies. This is where my life changed. I was finally exposed to computers and the internet regularly. During my first year, I learned about HTML and CSS. I discovered text editors like Sublime Text, VS Code, and Vim. I made numerous pages‚Äîbasic landing pages, forms with various styles, navbars, footers, and more. But that was just the beginning. In my second year, I learned about JavaScript. This was one of the pages that I made in the beginning` },
        { type: "image", value: image1 },
        { type: "text", value: `At first, JavaScript was confusing. I borrowed a friend‚Äôs laptop and researched web development, and I finally got the answer to the question that had been eating me alive: "\How do I deploy my website?\" That‚Äôs when I discovered GitHub. I didn‚Äôt yet know how to build a proper webpage, so I searched YouTube and found a tutorial on making a portfolio. At that point, my focus was purely on deploying my website. The video provided source code for a portfolio page, which was exactly what I needed. I quickly created a GitHub account, put the source code in VS Code, made a few tweaks, and pushed my files to GitHub. Since GitHub provides free hosting, I used it, and my first-ever webpage went live on the internet.` },

        { type: "text", value: `Five minutes later, I rushed to my phone, opened a browser, and typed in the GitHub-provided link. And guess what? My website was live! I could access it from anywhere. It wasn‚Äôt responsive for smaller screens, but at that moment, I didn‚Äôt care‚ÄîI was overwhelmed with happiness.` },

        { type: "text", value: `After high school, I returned to my hometown for vacation, and something amazing happened‚ÄîI finally got my own laptop, the one thing I had wanted for so long. Now, nothing was stopping me. I searched for web development tutorials on YouTube and started learning properly.` },

        { type: "text", value: `I found a channel called SuperSimpleDev and learned HTML and CSS. Since I already had prior knowledge, it was easy, but this guy‚Äôs way of teaching made it even more engaging. He gave exercises in the middle of the videos, which made learning interactive. For the first time, I built my portfolio page from scratch and hosted it via GitHub. Then, I started learning JavaScript again, and this time, it wasn‚Äôt as hard as I had thought.` },

        { type: "text", value: `While learning JavaScript, I discovered that the government of Nepal provides free .com.np domains. I immediately visited the official website and applied for pushkarniraula.com.np. Sadly, my request was rejected twice. That‚Äôs when I searched YouTube and found a video explaining how to request a domain properly. I followed the steps carefully and applied again. After about a week, I finally got my domain. I set it up and connected it to my webpage. Now, I had my own website with my own domain.` },

        { type: "text", value: `I learned JavaScript fundamentals and built fun projects like a digital clock, rock-paper-scissors game, and color picker. But soon, I had to pause my learning to prepare for university. I decided to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and got admitted to Lalitpur Engineering College.` },

        { type: "text", value: `During my first few weeks in college, I struggled to manage my time due to a new environment, assignments, lab reports, and tests. But after about two months, I found balance. Although I couldn‚Äôt dedicate as much time to web development as before, I always made sure to spend at least one hour a day on it. Once I became confident in JavaScript, I quickly moved to React. Now, in my second year (third semester), I am learning backend development. Besides that, I also know C, C++, Python, and have explored Django and data science, although I‚Äôm not yet proficient in them.` },

        { type: "text", value: `Looking back, I‚Äôm amazed at how far I‚Äôve come. From tinkering with phones as a kid to building and deploying my own websites, this journey has been incredible. There were many obstacles‚Äîlack of access to computers, limited internet, and time management issues‚Äîbut my curiosity and persistence kept me going.` },

        { type: "text", value: `If I could tell my past self one thing, it would be: \‚ÄúKeep exploring and never stop learning. Even if things seem difficult, you'll figure them out step by step.\‚Äù My dream now is to become a successful full-stack developer, and I know that with continuous learning and practice, I‚Äôll get there.` },
